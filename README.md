# Packweave Specification & Cognitive Architecture

Packweave is a **spec-driven cognitive framework** that turns automation into *governed, intent-aligned behavior*.  
Traditional systems automate tasks.  
Packweave automates **purpose**.

It defines:
- **Intents** — the “why” behind a system  
- **Traits** — reusable fragments of behavior  
- **Use Cases** — observable, testable units of capability  
- **Patterns** — learned wisdom from successful executions  
- **Governance** — a constitutional layer that prevents drift

Together they form a **five-layer cognitive fabric** that can reason, learn, align, and self-correct.

This repository provides the **public specification layer** for Packweave:  
- The *Use-Case Architecture* (v5)  
- The *Cognitive Fabric Manifesto* (v3)  
- Trait definitions, examples, and composition rules  
- Guidance for implementers (ESP32, servers, agents, LLM orchestrators)

It is intentionally **pure spec** — no servers, no devices, no clutter.

## 🚀 What Packweave Is

Packweave is a way to build systems that don’t “just run tasks” —  
they **remember purpose**, **reason about alignment**, **collaborate** safely,  
and **learn from every outcome**.

Packweave introduces a new mental model:

> **Software isn’t a pipeline.  
> It’s a living conversation — between intent, action, and learning.**

## 📘 Core Documents in This Repository

### **1. Packweave Use-Case Architecture — Master Specification (v5)**  
Defines the structure of:
- Use Cases  
- Traits  
- Taxonomies  
- Templates  
- Composition patterns  
- Governance rules  
- Telemetry and decision semantics

Use Cases become the **contract** for every Packweave capability.  
Traits provide reusable, declarative behavior.  
Together they form a **flattened, composable behavioral architecture**.

### **2. Packweave 2.0 — The Cognitive Fabric Manifesto (v3)**  
A deep conceptual blueprint describing:
- Intent preservation  
- Anchors and drift detection  
- Reasoning cycles (Compass)  
- Collaboration protocols (Bridge)  
- Pattern evolution  
- Collective learning  
- The five-layer cognitive architecture  
- The emerging role of Packweave as an organizational memory system

This document frames Packweave as a **governed, reasoning infrastructure**, not just a technical pattern.

## 🧩 The Packweave Model

### **Intents**
The immutable *why*.  
Captured in an `intent_manifest`.  
Anchored, signed, and lineage-tracked.

### **Traits**
Reusable behavioral fragments that inject:
- Telemetry
- Logging
- Signature requirements
- Rollout rules
- Drift detection
- Async flow models

Traits replace inheritance with **composition**.

### **Use Cases**
Concrete, observable behaviors.  
Each UC:
- Declares an intent  
- Defines actor, preconditions, flow, postconditions  
- Attaches traits  
- Emits audit logs and telemetry  
- Forms the basis for agents, firmware, or services

### **Patterns**
Learned “what works” —  
derived from real execution, validated by governance, reused everywhere.

### **Governance Layer**
The constitutional rules:
- Drift classification  
- Ethical boundaries  
- Approval workflows  
- Anchor continuity checks  
- Pattern promotion and retirement

Packweave is **self-steering**:  
systems halt, rollback, or escalate on drift automatically.

## 🏗️ Why Publish This Specification?

This repo is the **source of truth** for:
- Tooling implementers  
- Device firmware engineers  
- Governance designers  
- AI agent builders  
- Researchers exploring cognitive infrastructure  
- Anyone using Packweave as a foundation

It ensures Packweave remains:
- Transparent  
- Auditable  
- Standardized  
- Vendor-neutral  
- Easy to build on  

The spec is intentionally **public** so the ecosystem can grow around a stable, governed core.

## 🔮 The Vision

Packweave’s long-term trajectory is to become:

> **The cognitive substrate for organizations.**  
Where intent, reasoning, learning, and governance converge as first-class primitives.

It evolves automation into:
- Systems that **explain themselves**  
- Agents that **remember purpose**  
- Networks that **share wisdom**  
- Infrastructure that **self-corrects**  
- Engineering that becomes a **living conversation**

Packweave is the blueprint for building **aligned, adaptive, collective intelligence**.
